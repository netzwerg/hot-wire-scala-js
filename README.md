What is this?
-------------
Status indicator for some [MaKey MaKey](http://makeymakey.com) Hot Wire fun

Why is this here?
-----------------
Because kids want to play Hot Wire, and Mums wants to hack [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org)

How to build?
-------------
Use `sbt ~fastOptJS` and open `index-fastopt.html` (see underlying [bootstrapping skeleton]
(https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-example-app) for more details)

Can I play it?
--------------
Well, the [MaKey MaKey](http://makeymakey.com) Hot Wire part you need to create yourself, but this indicator is
deployed [here](http://netzwerg.ch/hotwire) (press any key to mimic the MaKey MaKey, ENTER to reset)
